Brief
The objective of this project was to create. CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodoligies and technologies, covered within the training period. The scope of the project was to create a tracking board for user stories/use cases, to create a relational database with t least 2 tables that shared some form of relationship, have clear documenttion alongside. risk assesment a functional CRUD application, adequate testing and deployment.

  Intended Solution 
The intended solution was to be a music lyric database in which the user would be able to register, login into the account they had made, add a song and/or its remix. Alongside this was to be a to search, edit and delete songs within the databases.

In the end I was able to create  CRUD application that had a relationship not involving the user but rather the orginal songs and the remix songs.

Testing
The testing was intended to be done using pytest. This would be to test all basic functions to mke sure product is able to be presented as the minimum viable product. Alongside the pytest, Selenium would be used to test the integrtion aspects of the app.




Deployment Technologies Used
The intended form of deployment would have been to incorporate Jenkins into the development and integration process, with each commit and push to git initiating a test and if successful being pushed online to be part of the fuctioning app.




Front-end Design
The design was intended to be a muted purple and minimal as a homage to the lyric database site azlyrics. This was achieved by making sure only necessary data was displayed. The font and styling were left as the defualt styling built into the flask platform as it fit the intended output.




Improvements for Future
Currently the databases there is enough functionality for the intended project. But being ble to complete it and add all the intended functionality from the solution would gretly improve the experience. Other improvements include implementing testing and Continous Integration methodology. 

Changes I would make to the process of creating this project are to better structure my sprints and time spent on specific tasks. Focusing on key elements of the product that the end could not function without e.g. the lyric databases and not the login etc.

In earlier sprints it seemed as though the task would be very simple and required pure regurgitation of content to complete. But as I got along to later sprints it became clear that what I had intended to complete and my minimum vible product were too complex for the amount of time given for the project to be completed. Also to start small would be the main take away from this project for me.
